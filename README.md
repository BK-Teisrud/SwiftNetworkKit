# SwiftNetworkKit

[![CI](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A native networking library for Apple platforms, distributed as a Swift package with no external package dependencies.

**Status: F2 is closed after the accepted non-publishing HTTP-core rehearsal.** The selected core and recorded minimum/non-Watch evidence are documented in the [F2 closeout](docs/planning/F2_CLOSEOUT_2026-10-31.md). No stable version/tag or release exists. Physical Watch #132 and actual workload/security/publication #29 remain mandatory. Bounded retry implementation I24–I27 is authorized under ADR-0014/#137. The bounded F3 technical gate is accepted with recorded limitations; see the [F3 closeout](docs/planning/F3_CLOSEOUT_2026-11-01.md) and #110 for formal completion.

Open the repository-root Package.swift in Xcode. The package is named SwiftNetworkKit and exposes the NetworkKit library. Tests cover HTTP values, configuration, construction, response interpretation, session ownership, network policy and client integration, with platform-specific evidence described in the guides. See [implementation authorization](docs/decisions/ADR-0012-implementation-start.md).

## Project foundations

Foundation/URLSession is the primary HTTP transport. Swift Concurrency, injectable services, system trust, and privacy-preserving defaults guide the design. Network.framework may be considered for specific low-level requirements. The project will not implement its own HTTP, TLS, or cryptographic stack, or provide a backend product.

The repository and package are named **SwiftNetworkKit**. The library product, module, and import name are **NetworkKit**, with one library module in v1. The first stable release is limited to the HTTP core; other modules are deferred. The package and selected HTTP core are implemented; rehearsal and separate publication gates remain distinct. See [v1 scope](docs/planning/V1_SCOPE.md) and [ADR-0003](docs/decisions/ADR-0003-v1-scope-and-naming.md).

## Platforms and rights

Approved v1 targets: **iOS/iPadOS 17+, macOS 14+, watchOS 10+, and tvOS 17+**. visionOS is deferred. Development baseline: **Xcode 26.3+, Swift tools 6.2, and Swift 6 language mode with strict concurrency checking**. See the [platform matrix](docs/planning/PLATFORM_MATRIX.md) and [ADR-0004](docs/decisions/ADR-0004-platforms-and-toolchain.md). PR CI now builds all four platform families and runs the product contract tests on macOS plus iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV simulators. The required quality-gate also covers source integrity and DocC. Minimum-family and non-Watch physical evidence are accepted within the exact patch/architecture/suite limits in the platform matrix. Physical Watch #132 and the separate publication/workload decision #29 remain open.
