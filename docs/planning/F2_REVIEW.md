# F2 selected-requirement reconciliation — preliminary

Current public-fixture decision, 2026-10-27: the owner selected [HTTPBingo/BadSSL verification](PUBLIC_HTTPS_VERIFICATION.md), NET-01 #115, instead of provisioning a paid/private HTTPS server. Public native observations are allowed for claims they actually support. Earlier controlled-fixture requirements still apply to server-counter/zero-contact claims; minimum/physical/resource/archive/privacy and owner release gates remain. Earlier no-endpoint statements below preserve their historical context.

Date: 2026-10-27. Owner/task: @BK-Teisrud / GATE-F2 #86. Status: INCOMPLETE; this is preparatory reconciliation, not F2 acceptance or release authorization.

Baseline: accepted main `d64ef1ff09985dc2d6e30603fefd3e39ed1d6a3e` (PR #105). [Main run 40556606300](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/actions/runs/40556606300) passed all seven jobs, including macOS 218 tests/28 suites and four simulator targets 215 tests/26 suites each. Full logs verified typed/raw certificate-specific rejection and cleanup, release smoke and control typechecking, without unexpected restarts/time-limit failures. This is inherited accepted evidence, not a new run and not minimum/physical execution. PR #111's proposed retry work is excluded from this baseline and from v1.

## Source, IDs and claim boundary

Re-read original specification v1.0 §4.1–4.4, §4.13–4.16, §4.18 and §4.20. Stable NK-domain subrequirement IDs below follow original bullet order, including bullets continued across pages. These IDs add traceability, not scope. Selected/partial/deferred dispositions interpret already accepted [v1 scope](V1_SCOPE.md) and ADR-0003/0005/0006/0007; they do not override them. A mismatch must receive an explicit impact decision, never be silently declared delivered.

Evidence IDs refer to exact named tests in [the contract ledger](TEST_EVIDENCE.md) and [current inventory](TEST_INVENTORY.md). Each row inherits the accepted baseline/run above; issue IDs identify original slices, with their PR/main history on GitHub. Tests prove the bounded assertions under the ledger's scripted/native platform limitations, not universal target behavior. Every selected/partial row remains subject to applicable ENV evidence and final acceptance; none closes its epic by table membership. Keep historical run counts unchanged.

## Cross-cutting extension foundations

#12 / NK-05: only once-per-call headers, explicit opt-out and account/origin binding are selected (S08–S10, I14). Login, Keychain, OAuth/OIDC and refresh remain deferred. #13 / NK-06: HTTPS/system trust, safe redirects and credentials are core foundations (S01–S04, I09/I19/TLS-01); pinning/mTLS/HMAC/custom trust remain deferred. #24 / NK-17: session reuse, baseline and attribution support core quality (L04, I20/RES-01); coalescing, streaming and optimization products remain deferred. #26 / NK-19: declared platforms and availability support core (C01/C02, I18); background transfers, local discovery, app groups and visionOS remain deferred. Keep these extension epics open: foundations do not deliver their future catalog.

## Remaining evidence and exact closure sequence

| Gate | Required outcome | Current disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #62 / ENV-01–05 and applicable resource scenarios | Execute iPhone/iOS 17, iPad/iPadOS 17, macOS 14, watchOS 10 and tvOS 17 with exact candidate/OS/build/fixture | Partial: four exact minimum simulator root regressions (215/215 each) accepted through PR #120/main 40765690271. Native ARM64 macOS 14.8.9 consumer/reuse/cancellation/100-cycle controls passed in run 41179430976; see MACOS14_EXECUTION_ROUTE_2026-10-29.md. Actual ARM64 macOS 14.8.9 HTTPS run 41204068268 on accepted b8f2758 passed all ten cases with exact Foundation corroboration. NET-03 #122 and NET-04 #126 are accepted. #62 result custody/documentation awaits this PR/main acceptance; exact 14.0, Intel macOS 14 and full older-host regression execution are not claimed. |
| #63 / ENV-01–07 | Representative physical iPhone/iPad/Mac/Watch/TV; native networking, transitions, cancellation, storage, safe diagnostics and resource suitability | In progress: accepted Mac/iPhone evidence retains its limits. Candidate iPad 215 regression + 20/21 native with supplemental strict typed/raw TLS diagnostic; TV 215 regression + 21 native, storage and finite resources passed. Watch signed preparation is complete but its development tunnel/readiness is unresolved. Candidate iPad/iPhone actual ENV-06 reports now include path loss -1009, same-client concurrent recovery and post-budget samples. Mac outage, TV transitions, Watch and remaining applicability/resource disposition stay open |
| #62/#63 / ENV-02 | Controlled system-trusted success; separate invalid chain and hostname mismatch, typed/raw, plus native redirect/challenge evidence | Public native HTTPBingo/BadSSL results cover the recorded Mac/iPhone/minimum-simulator and candidate iPad/TV claims; current iPad supplemental diagnostics retain the earlier failed corroboration. macOS 14 native HTTPS is now executed and verified; physical Watch remains open. Controlled-counter claims are not inferred from public responses |
| #62/#63 / ENV-07 | Actual target call rate/concurrency/payload/budget, cleanup and post-original-deadline resource observation | Accepted local/minimum NET-03 and macOS 14 bounded controls plus candidate iPad/TV measurements exist. Physical Watch, remaining transitions and target/workload disposition remain open; finite RSS does not establish a universal cap |
| #86 | Complete all selected rows, applicable target results and explicit deferrals; review/close eligible core epics with evidence | Remains Blocked/open. This preliminary matrix does not satisfy the gate. Do not create a dependency on #64 or #29 |
| #64 then #27 | Clean-consumer rehearsal, all build/test gates, rights/DocC/changelog; actual archive manifest inclusion and aggregate privacy report | Formal acceptance pending #86/#63. Consumer/archive and aggregate report preparation is complete, including a nonshipping SDK-manifest positive control. #27 stays open for rehearsal; no circular blocker |
| #29 | Explicit owner release/risk decision and actual authorized release/tag/install verification | Pending. Preparing release evidence is authorized; tag/publication remains a separate decision |

[Environment readiness](ENVIRONMENT_READINESS.md) defines precise ENV scenarios and sanitized record fields. [Security/privacy review](SECURITY_PRIVACY_REVIEW.md) defines independent trust cases and final app/archive responsibilities. [Repeated-call attribution](REPEATED_CALL_MEMORY.md) preserves uncertainty about runtime helper retention and resident pages; no scheduler rewrite or universal memory cap is justified. Preserve the original unexplained fixture/iOS timeout incidents even after passing follow-ups.

## Historical access refresh and next actions — 2026-10-27

Read-only CoreDevice/simulator inventory on 2026-10-27 again found no iOS 17/tvOS 17/watchOS 10 runtime. Stored/discovered iPhone 17 Pro (27.2/24B119) and Watch Ultra 2 (26.6/23U67) have disconnected network tunnels; iPad Pro 11-inch third generation (27.0.1/24A446) has unavailable tunnel. Per-device DDI services are unavailable; iPhone Developer Mode is enabled, iPad/Watch disabled. TV is not listed, which does not establish absence. These were the initial records, not execution proof. The following owner/connection update supersedes only the iPhone connectivity observation. No settings, pairing, signing, deployment, runtime install or root change occurred. Private identifiers/raw inventory remain outside the repository.

The owner subsequently reports iPhone 17 Pro/iOS 27.2, Watch Ultra 2/watchOS 27.2, iPad Pro/iPadOS 27.2, MacBook Pro/macOS 15.8.1 and Apple TV 4K/tvOS 27.2, with no known controlled HTTPS/domain access. These newer versions do not establish minimum-version access. Watch/iPad/TV versions remain owner-reported; older stored Watch/iPad records differ and are not fresh observations.

After the owner connected/unlocked the iPhone, CoreDevice observed iPhone 17 Pro/iOS 27.2 (24B119), wired tunnel connected, paired, Developer Mode enabled and DDI services available. A read-only lock query found no passcode required and unlocked since boot. Xcode accepted its physical destination in a build-settings query. This resolves the iPhone communication prerequisite only, not signing/deployment/execution compatibility. An unsigned `xcodebuild build-for-testing` then succeeded for the physical destination with CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO and warnings as errors, producing an arm64 iPhoneOS 26.2 xctestrun plan for NetworkKitTests with the system xctest host. The built NetworkKit resource bundle includes PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy; this is not a consumer archive aggregate privacy report. No test executed in that unsigned build.

One existing valid code-signing identity was available (identity details remain private). The owner explicitly authorized signing and installing/running this test package on the connected iPhone, but not creating certificates/profiles or changing the Apple account. The signed build succeeded using only that existing identity with manual signing and no provisioning-update option. `codesign --verify --strict` succeeded for the built NetworkKitTests bundle. The subsequent authorized `test-without-building` exited 70 before tests ran: tool-hosted testing is unavailable on device destinations and requires a host application. No physical test result is claimed. [Sanitized attempt evidence](evidence/F2_IPHONE_ATTEMPT_2026-10-27.json) records the separation of build/signature/launch results.

PREP-02 / #113 now owns the smallest explicit app-hosted iOS test route, Ready/P1/CORE/Order 20.9 under #23, with accepted #41/#59 prerequisites and a native blocker on #63. Build it unsigned for review before selecting its signing/install route. The previous approval applied to the earlier package artefact; no new host has been installed. Other physical families require their own applicability/host decisions. Do not infer newer device incompatibility from SDK version alone. Do not replace controlled HTTPS with an uncontrolled public endpoint or install trust roots. If access cannot be obtained, keep the gate open and present actual support/scope alternatives for an explicit decision; do not waive evidence simply to close F2.

## Quality and backlog assessment

The main reconciliation gap was traceability: generic epic checkboxes did not enumerate the accepted/deferred source bullets. This matrix supplies that review index while reusing existing tests, contracts and issue owners. No product defect, additional product feature, framework, broad refactor or new milestone is established. One bounded PREP-02 test-infrastructure task is justified by the actual tool-hosting failure; this is not a duplicate of the broader #63 evidence owner. #62/#63 remain independent; both block #86, followed by #64 and the separate #29 release decision. F3 retry planning cannot satisfy an F2 gate. Required PR/main checks are recorded in #86 before this preparation is accepted; acceptance of this document alone closes no epic or phase.

## PREP-02 implementation follow-up

[The app-hosted iOS route](IOS_DEVICE_TEST_HOST.md) and [host runbook](../../Tools/DeviceTestHost/README.md) now provide a minimal local host/test project using all 22 shared test/helper files. App-hosted iOS 26.2 simulator execution passed 215/215 tests, zero skipped/failed/expected failures. This supersedes the earlier no-host preparation state only; no minimum/native-complete/F2 acceptance follows. Existing-profile app-hosted execution on iPhone 17 Pro/iOS 27.2 passed 215/215 tests with zero skipped/failed/expected failures, and the temporary host was removed. Required PR/main acceptance remains on #113; #63 retains ENV-01–07 and actual resource/HTTPS evidence. No product-source change or new milestone is selected.

## NET-01 acceptance / NET-02 follow-up — 2026-10-28

NET-01 #115 is accepted through PR #116 and main 40644612904. [NET-02 #117](NATIVE_LIFECYCLE_STORAGE.md) adds bounded native cancellation/shutdown/cookie observations; #63 retains complete target/ENV/resource evidence. [Three exact minimum-runtime candidates](MINIMUM_RUNTIME_ACCESS_2026-10-28.md) were initially catalogued with anonymous unauthorized HTML responses. The authenticated follow-up verifies all three imports and architecture inventory; [four actual minimum simulator root regressions](MINIMUM_RUNTIME_EXECUTION_2026-10-28.md) subsequently passed locally, 215/215 each. macOS 14 and separate native/resource scenarios remain open; new evidence awaits PR/main acceptance. NET-02 is accepted through PR #118/main 40745209513. No F2 or release criterion is waived.

## Minimum macOS access route — 2026-10-29

PR #120 minimum simulator regression evidence is accepted through main run 40765690271. The owner has no second Mac. The [temporary standard GitHub macOS 14 route](MACOS14_EXECUTION_ROUTE_2026-10-29.md) builds a public consumer with Xcode 26.3 and runs the unchanged executable on the older OS; it is not an older-toolchain build or a support change. Actual execution and its exact patch/build remain pending, as do the other selected native/resource/physical/archive/release gates.

## Current priority refresh — 2026-10-31

Main 0ab623fe67e1be161f2ef1f3ac2fc67107cebb70 is accepted through run 41179384664. The prepared macOS 14 consumer route has completed, with [preserved results](evidence/MACOS14_RUNTIME_2026-10-31.json); its one-off workflow is retired. The earlier access statements above are historical, not the current claim that no macOS 14 route exists.

Continue NET-03 #122: review/negative controls and expanded minimum/physical loopback results, then remaining #63 device-family and foreground/background/network-loss evidence. Previous temporary NET-03 device/simulator records were unavailable on resumption and are not accepted for that candidate. Resource measurements remain observations requiring workload suitability and owner risk disposition. Keep #62/#63 open and reconcile #86 only after their applicable requirements are satisfied; #64 consumer/archive/privacy rehearsal follows its acceptance dependencies. No duplicate environment issue, scope expansion, retry implementation or support-minimum change is warranted by this access result.

NET-03 candidate update (2026-10-31, review pending): the fresh iOS/iPadOS 17.0 simulator runs each passed the expanded opt-in suite, 19 declarations / 40 parameter cases. Physical iPhone 17 Pro/iOS 27.2 passed seven selected loopback declarations / 14 cases. Zero failures/skips/expected failures; cleanup succeeded. [NET-03](NET03_NATIVE_LOOPBACK.md) preserves isolated negative controls, source hashes and limits. These candidate results do not establish accepted main, physical iPad/Watch/TV, minimum Watch/TV native scenarios, physical transitions, SDK app-managed HTTPS cache/credential behavior or archive/privacy acceptance. No gate is closed from these results.

Minimum-native follow-up, 2026-10-31: [Watch/TV execution](MINIMUM_NATIVE_EXECUTION_2026-10-31.md) on accepted 5d2ae116 completed with TV 17/19 and Watch 16/19 declarations passed. Zero skips/expected failures; failed public timeouts and Watch Foundation-challenge/app-managed cookie controls remain failures. A later plain Foundation TV control passed but does not explain the SDK timeouts. NET-04 #126 is P1 CORE and blocks affected #62/#63 claims; no F2 acceptance, skipped assertion or support change. Owner workload remains unknown, so no app-specific resource suitability is accepted.
