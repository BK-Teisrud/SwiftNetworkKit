# Work queue

## Current delivery — 2026-11-01

The bounded F3 technical gate is accepted on PR #143/main e0282dc29ac2247a7c2b6e142e37e7ed3cb5be24/run 41299838862 after the owner's explicit limited approval. [Final closeout](F3_CLOSEOUT_2026-11-01.md) records scope, evidence and preserved release barriers. Formal I27/milestone closure follows the final documentation's required PR/main acceptance and is recorded in #110/milestone 4. I24–I26 are Done; no remaining feature implementation is selected for F3.

#132 physical Watch and #29 actual app/workload/security/publication remain mandatory. Existing PLAN-F4 #88 is the next planning candidate only after confirming an actual transfer need; no further extension code or release is authorized. [Status history](F3_STATUS_HISTORY_2026-11-01.md) preserves earlier snapshots separately from this live summary.

## Accepted F2 and next lanes

The [F2 closeout](F2_CLOSEOUT_2026-10-31.md) records accepted core hardening/rehearsal, final main d0a522770269617f95660d67e9d0198838dc2bb5/run 41244932962 and the milestone-counter discrepancy. Original submission-time evidence/failure limits remain immutable. The F2-only resource disposition is not F3 or production acceptance.

After I27, existing PLAN-F4 #88 is the next planning candidate only after confirming a real transfer need; #89/#90 remain independent research. Domain #14 stays open for deferred advanced resilience. Publication #29 and Watch #132 retain their separate blockers. Stop whenever GitHub execution is pending; resume only after the owner's next instruction, without queue polling or independent work across that stop.

## Accepted core implementation history

**Historical core authorization on 2026-10-20; [START-00 / #41](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/issues/41) is closed.** [ADR-0012](../decisions/ADR-0012-implementation-start.md) records the instruction. I01 established the package baseline. I02 implements foundational HTTP values/errors and their tests; I03 adds isolated configuration snapshots and internal transport/clock seams; I04 adds safe endpoint/URL construction and shared raw-URL validation; I05 adds buffered request encoding, call headers/options, and raw preparation; I06 adds real platform/source/DocC CI and required quality-gate enforcement; I07 adds buffered response strategies and per-call status validation; I08 adds the internal owned/borrowed URLSession adapter; I09 adds shared HTTPS/origin/loopback policy and per-operation redirect/trust delegates; I10 connects typed/raw calls to the public shared HTTP pipeline. I11 verifies the F1 contract/evidence boundary; see [F1 review](F1_REVIEW.md) and #52 for actual acceptance. I12 adds per-call cancellation/terminal arbitration and the monotonic total budget; see [timing evidence](CANCELLATION_AND_BUDGET.md). I13 adds explicit shutdown, operation registration and concurrent-call verification; see [lifecycle evidence](SHUTDOWN_AND_CONCURRENCY.md). I14 adds the [bounded authentication-header provider](AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER.md), with app-owned login/token storage and no refresh/replay. I15 adds [optional sanitized diagnostics](SANITIZED_DIAGNOSTICS.md), disabled by default with a fixed metadata allowlist. I16 verifies [storage profiles against a controlled local server](STORAGE_VERIFICATION.md) and exposes the explicit app-managed borrowed-session selection. I17 accepted the [contract/regression ledger](TEST_EVIDENCE.md) and [test inventory](TEST_INVENTORY.md) through PR #93 / main run 40377796452. I18 reviews the [public API and compiled integration guide](API_REVIEW.md); its acceptance remains recorded in #59. The 2026-10-26 planning review adds PREP-01 / #85 (Order 16.5) as the early planning action (accepted through PR #92 and main run 40374198746; see [environment readiness](ENVIRONMENT_READINESS.md) and #85) and GATE-F2 / #86 (Order 22.5) before rehearsal; see [plan audit](PLAN_REVIEW_2026-10-26.md).

Choose the lowest Order with closed blockers and satisfied Ready criteria. This is a recommended serial sequence for one developer, not a schedule. Reordering requires dependency review rather than new scope. See the [Work Queue](https://github.com/users/BK-Teisrud/projects/6/views/7).

Historical review, 2026-10-27: preparation PR #103 is accepted through main run 40550211780. [TLS-01 / #104](NATIVE_TLS_REJECTION.md), Order 20.75, adds independently executable native macOS untrusted-certificate rejection coverage. It blocks #86 while #62/#63 remain Blocked for actual minimum/physical execution. System-trusted positive HTTPS and independent hostname-mismatch evidence are still missing. No support/tool change or owner-risk acceptance is inferred.

## Why this sequence

Values/configuration precede URL/request encoding. Real CI follows early meaningful tests and precedes further transport work. Response handling, transport, and network policy form a vertical HTTP slice before the F1 gate. Then verify timing, lifecycle, authentication, and privacy together. API/DocC and security review precede resource measurements and actual runtime/device evidence. Environment access is investigated early. Minimum-runtime and newer-device execution do not block each other; both must pass the F2 reconciliation. Rehearsal publishes nothing.

Every issue includes acceptance criteria and tests. Relevant tests/docs accompany each implementation PR; they are not deferred to I17/I18, which are consolidated reviews. Native blockers/subissues are configured but do not independently enforce merges.

I21 may investigate access to older test environments as preparation without code; actual product tests require implementation. Missing access blocks release. If evidence cannot be obtained, explicitly revisit support rather than automatically downgrading devices or buying equipment.

## Post-v1 planning queue

| Order | Planning task | Domain coverage | Readiness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30 | [PLAN-F3 / #87](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/issues/87) | #14 first; assess #12/#15/#19/#24 separately | Done; ADR-0014 and selected I24–I27 decomposition accepted |
| 40 | [PLAN-F4 / #88](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/issues/88) | #16/#26 | Backlog; transfer use cases/feasibility pending |
| 50 | [PLAN-F5 / #89](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/issues/89) | #17 | Backlog; real-time use case/lifecycle pending |
| 60 | [PLAN-F6 / #90](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/issues/90) | #13/#18 | Backlog; research need/stop-go criteria pending |

These are governance/planning tasks, not authorized extension implementation. F2 is complete; the selected F3 gate is current delivery work. Future epics have no Order and require new scope decisions; only selected implementation slices receive I identifiers. Parent epics may span phases; individual subtasks' milestones define delivery requirements. Reassess phase boundaries after selection and sizing, without inventing dates.

## Historical F2 closure preparation — 2026-10-27

[Preliminary F2 review](F2_REVIEW.md) indexes the ten core epics and 79 original source bullets without changing approved scope. #104 is accepted through main run 40556606300; #62/#63 actual access/execution and complete HTTPS/resource evidence remain Blocked. Both precede #86; #64 and #27 rehearsal follow, and #29 retains separate release authorization. Preparation does not satisfy those gates. F3 candidate work in other branches remains outside this F2 baseline.

Physical iPhone follow-up: [PREP-02 / #113](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/issues/113) is Ready/P1/CORE/Order 20.9 under #23, blocked by accepted START/I18 and blocking I22. Unsigned/signed builds succeeded, but actual device execution failed before tests because package tool-hosted tests need an app host. See [sanitized evidence](evidence/F2_IPHONE_ATTEMPT_2026-10-27.json). This is the next bounded F2 preparation task; no physical test pass or new host installation is claimed.

PREP-02 implementation: [app-hosted iOS route](IOS_DEVICE_TEST_HOST.md) reuses all shared test files with drift guards and an unsigned device build in ios-core. Its 215-test app-hosted simulator and physical iPhone 17 Pro/iOS 27.2 runs passed; the temporary host was removed. Required PR/main checks remain on #113. Keep #63/#86 open for their complete evidence.

NET-01 / [#115](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/issues/115), P1 CORE Order 20.95 under #23, follows accepted I19/PREP-02 and blocks I22. [Public HTTPS verification](PUBLIC_HTTPS_VERIFICATION.md) supplies bounded native observations without provisioning a paid server; normal CI compiles only. #62 minimum access remains independent and all unproved native/resource/release claims stay open.

NET-01 #115 accepted through PR #116/main 40644612904. NET-02 #117 accepted through PR #118/main 40745209513. NET-02 / [#117](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/issues/117), P1 CORE Order 20.96 under #23, follows accepted NET-01/PREP-02 and blocks I22. [Native lifecycle/storage observations](NATIVE_LIFECYCLE_STORAGE.md) remain separate from full ENV/resource/transition acceptance. [Minimum-runtime leads and authorization](MINIMUM_RUNTIME_ACCESS_2026-10-28.md) belong to independent #62; all three imports and [four separate minimum simulator regression runs](MINIMUM_RUNTIME_EXECUTION_2026-10-28.md) are now verified locally (215/215 each). A fresh iPhone boot completed after earlier migration timeouts. macOS 14 and remaining native/resource requirements remain open; this evidence awaits its PR/main acceptance.

Minimum macOS follow-up, 2026-10-29: [temporary standard GitHub macOS 14 execution route](MACOS14_EXECUTION_ROUTE_2026-10-29.md) prepares an exact-source prebuilt public consumer with the approved builder. Actual macOS 14 results are pending; observe brownout/retirement and stop at CI-dependent points. PR #120 minimum simulator evidence is accepted through main run 40765690271. Remaining native/physical/resource/rehearsal requirements are unchanged.

## Historical planning before complete approval — 2026-10-31

#87 and F3-DEC #106 are planning work. [Proposed ADR-0014](../decisions/ADR-0014-opt-in-retry-proposal.md) and [contract/decomposition](RETRY_INCREMENT_PLAN.md) record owner selections; complete acceptance/code start remain pending. Existing candidates #107/#108/#109/#110 stay Backlog, no I identifiers. Planned order is decision → eligibility/delay contracts → one-operation integration → native/resource verification → increment gate. Preserve the accepted F2 rows and separate #132/#29 publication lane. A documentation PR or generic continue instruction does not authorize retry code.
