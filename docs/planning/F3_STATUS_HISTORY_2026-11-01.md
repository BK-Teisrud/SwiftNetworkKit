## I26 actual macOS 14 result — 2026-11-01

[Actual ARM64/macOS 14.8.9 retry execution](I26_MACOS14_RETRY_EXECUTION_2026-11-01.md) passes run 41294523457 on accepted main 660f8c099faccdd4215ad5e4bf1d082faaa3e403. Six native cases and four bounded resource workloads pass with exact source/payload custody. The one-off workflow is disabled and removed in the cleanup candidate. I26's selected verification is satisfied under documented limits; await cleanup PR/main acceptance before Done and I27. Physical Watch #132, unknown workload/production suitability and publication #29 remain mandatory; no new feature issue or broad resource refactor is justified.

## I26 minimum retry priority — 2026-11-01

PR #140/main run 41290108646 is accepted. [Fresh minimum retry evidence](I26_MINIMUM_RETRY_2026-11-01.md) passes 16 actual native parameter cases across iOS/iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10. Temporarily prioritize existing #109 as P1: the standard macOS 14 route retires November 2, so prepare its main-only exact-source retry/resource execution before I27. Actual macOS 14 execution and candidate PR/main acceptance remain pending; no physical pass, release waiver, new feature issue or paid route is implied. Remove the temporary workflow after disposition/retirement under existing #109/#110.

## I26 native/resource execution — 2026-11-01

I25 #108 is accepted through PR #139/main run 41287067291. I26 #109 adds [native retry/resource evidence](NATIVE_RETRY_VERIFICATION.md): actual Mac URLSession contacts, TLS exclusion, public HTTPS ownership composition and bounded release measurements. Candidate CI and target-applicability review remain pending; no new minimum/physical pass or publication acceptance is inferred. Existing #109/#110 and #132/#29 retain their distinct gates; no new feature issue or broad refactor is justified.

## I25 execution — 2026-11-01

I24 #107 is accepted through PR #138/main run 41250907636 (223 Mac tests, four 220-test simulator runs, 19 helpers). I25 #108 integrates explicit per-call retry inside one admitted operation/deadline; see [integration evidence](RETRY_INTEGRATION.md). I26/I27 remain dependent native/resource/API review tasks. No extra issue, dependency, broad refactor or release scope is justified by this change. This supersedes earlier I24-active/no-loop status below; required I25 PR/main acceptance is pending.

## Current F3 execution — 2026-10-31

Planning #87/#106 is accepted through PR #111/main `25e0d52b8316251bb6592d075caead9b05ed9edd`, verified run 41248255517. The owner explicitly authorized implementation of I24–I27 under ADR-0014; START-F3 #137 is completed. I24 #107 implements pure eligibility/delay decisions; I25–I27 remain dependent work. No retry transport loop, publication or other extension is delivered by I24. This status supersedes earlier no-code holds below. Existing four slices remain sufficient; no additional feature issue or broad refactor is justified.

## Complete retry contract approval — 2026-10-31

The owner approves the complete [ADR-0014 contract](../decisions/ADR-0014-opt-in-retry-proposal.md) and expressly withholds code. #87/#106 await planning PR/main acceptance; [START-F3 #137](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/issues/137) separately blocks selected I24–I27 (#107–#110). Existing F3 is now “F3 – Bounded read retries”; open unselected domain catalogs #12/#14/#15/#19/#24 stay outside this delivery milestone. No product code, default behavior, dependency, release/version/date or publication authorization. #132/#29 and accepted F2 remain unchanged.




## Earlier work-queue closeout/next-step text

## Accepted F2 closeout — 2026-10-31

F2 is CLOSED after PR #135/main `cc654ab5faadc0fc7fe00d7ad238b2e3ed5a997c`, [run 41242130528](https://github.com/BK-Teisrud/SwiftNetworkKit/actions/runs/41242130528), with full-log verification of 218 Mac tests, four 215 simulator suites, 19 helpers and four manual-host provenance checks without failure/restart markers. #64/#27 are Done; direct item lists and GraphQL verify no open F2 issues/PRs. [Closeout evidence](F2_CLOSEOUT_2026-10-31.md) records the milestone summary-counter disagreement and actual verified states.

Original candidate evidence files retain their submission-time pending flags and exact executed SDK/platform/failure limits. The owner resource approval is F2-only. #132 physical Watch and #29 actual workload/device-memory/security/publication decisions remain mandatory in their separate milestone, with support unchanged. No release/tag, production suitability or F3 implementation is authorized.

PLAN-F3 #87/#106 are In Review; the complete contract is owner-approved, but START-F3 #137 withholds implementation. I24–I27 are Blocked. Planning PR/main acceptance and a separate explicit code-start instruction remain required. Closed F2 is not publication or extension authorization.

## Next planning and publication lanes

1. #87 is Ready for planning only. Review bounded retry/draft PR #111 against accepted F2, answer contract questions and prepare its delivery backlog. Obtain explicit scope/start approval before F3 code.
2. #132 stays Blocked before #29 publication; actual physical Watch and owner workload/device-memory/security/publication decisions remain mandatory. Do not reopen F2 or mark Watch passed merely to publish.
3. Preserve closed-phase evidence and historical failure limits. No new milestone, dependency, paid service, support change or production feature is selected by closeout.

Stop whenever a GitHub run is pending and await the owner's instruction to continue. Do not poll CI or continue independent work across that stop, as reconfirmed on 2026-10-31. Conversation stays Norwegian; repository and project content stay English.

No product code, default behavior, dependency, release/version/date or publication authorization. #132/#29 and accepted F2 remain unchanged.


Current phase status, 2026-10-31: F2 is CLOSED through PR #135/main 41242130528; #64/#27 are Done and open item connections are empty. [Final closeout](F2_CLOSEOUT_2026-10-31.md) records accepted evidence and counter discrepancy. #87 is Ready for retry planning only; physical Watch #132 and publication/workload/security #29 remain separate blockers. No F3 code or release authorization. Dated progress below preserves history.


Current rehearsal, 2026-10-31: #86 and nine selected-core epics are Done through PR #134/main 41238957032. [Formal rehearsal](RELEASE_REHEARSAL_2026-10-31.md) is executed and awaits its PR/main acceptance; only #64/#27 remain open in F2. #132/#29 remain a separate mandatory publication lane. No release/tag, production acceptance or F3 implementation is authorized. Earlier dated progress retains its original context.


Current reconciliation, 2026-10-31: #62 and revised #63 are Done. [GATE-F2 review](F2_REVIEW.md) reconciles the 79 stable core IDs and recorded owner F2-only resource disposition; its PR/main acceptance precedes eligible core epic closures. #27 remains open for formal #64, then F2 closure. #132/#29 remain separate publication blockers; #87/draft PR #111 is planning, not F3 implementation authorization. Dated progress notes below preserve their original state.


Current owner decision, 2026-10-31: [ADR-0013](../decisions/ADR-0013-watch-publication-gate.md) moves only missing physical Watch verification to #132/#29 in the separate “v1.0 – Publication gate” milestone. watchOS 10 support is unchanged. F2 remains open for revised #63, #86 and formal #64/#27; publication and F3 implementation remain unauthorized. [Applicability matrix](F2_PHYSICAL_APPLICABILITY.md) and [work queue](WORK_QUEUE.md) supersede dated access notes below.


No deadlines are set. Phases are gates, not calendar promises. The owner selected HTTP core first: F0 → F1 → F2 completes non-publishing core hardening/rehearsal; a separate publication gate precedes the first stable release. F3–F6 are optional later deliveries, outside v1.0. Repository/package: SwiftNetworkKit; product/module: NetworkKit, with one library module. See [v1 scope](V1_SCOPE.md) and [ADR-0003](../decisions/ADR-0003-v1-scope-and-naming.md).

Current review: [TLS-01 native macOS rejection](NATIVE_TLS_REJECTION.md), a bounded P1 regression at Order 20.75 under #25. Preparation PR #103 is accepted through main run 40550211780; #62/#63 execution remains blocked by readiness/access. TLS-01 supplies local native negative evidence without selecting a new TLS product feature. F2 remains open for complete native/platform/resource and explicit owner-risk gates; no new milestone or support/tool change is selected.



## Earlier roadmap F2/F3 descriptions

## F2 – Production hardening and v1 gate

[Preliminary F2 requirement reconciliation](F2_REVIEW.md) maps 79 source bullets across the ten core epics to accepted scope, evidence and explicit deferrals. TLS-01 #104 is accepted through main run 40556606300. The connected iPhone builds/signs successfully, but tool-hosted device testing is unsupported; PREP-02 #113 adds the required app-host route before #63 execution. This preparation closes no phase/epic; #62/#63 actual target/HTTPS/resource evidence still precedes #86, #64 and the separate #29 release decision.

Current review, 2026-10-27: I20, RES-01 and preparation PR #103 are accepted; main run 40550211780 confirms the preparation baseline. TLS-01 / #104 is a selected P1 regression at Order 20.75, adding independently executable native macOS untrusted-certificate rejection. The original fixture/opaque iOS incident uncertainties remain recorded. #62/#63 execution remains Blocked by actual minimum/physical/controlled-HTTPS readiness. #86 requires #104 plus native/resource evidence, with explicit owner disposition before #29. No new milestone or product feature is selected.

Privacy/logging, cancellation, required authentication boundaries under DEC-04/06, security review, DocC, and a documented release gate. Release v1 only after all accepted core criteria are met. PREP-01 / #85 investigates environment access early; GATE-F2 / #86 reconciles domain requirements and evidence before I23 rehearsal. Minimum-runtime and newer-device execution are independent evidence branches after API/security review, and both must pass.

## F3 – Resilience and extensions

Deferred beyond v1. The owner selected retry/robustness as the first post-core planning priority on 2026-10-26. PLAN-F3 / #87 must select a small opt-in increment and approve its changed contract before implementation. Cache/authentication/monitoring/performance remain separate candidates; split delivery milestones if sizing warrants it.
