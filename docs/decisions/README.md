ADR-0009 records combined acceptance of the core choices and documented defaults in ADR-0002–ADR-0008. Those planning decisions did not authorize implementation; ADR-0012 records the later authorization.

Use the [template](TEMPLATE.md). A proposed ADR does not authorize implementation. Acceptance requires the owner's explicit decision in the associated issue/PR or recorded conversation. Preserve a trace when superseding historical decisions; create a new ADR instead of silently changing their substance.
