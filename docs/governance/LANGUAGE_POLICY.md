# Language policy

English is the working language of all repository documentation and GitHub project content. Norwegian remains the language of conversations between the owner and assistant. This policy is explicitly authorized in [ADR-0011](../decisions/ADR-0011-language-policy.md).

## Apply consistently

Write documentation, templates, configuration descriptions, issues, pull requests, GitHub comments, milestone names/descriptions, project fields/options/views, and future commit messages in clear English. Preserve established technical names and identifiers such as SwiftNetworkKit, NetworkKit, DEC-01, F0, and Order. Use one English term consistently across GitHub and versioned snapshots.

Existing editable issues and PRs are translated without changing their numbers, state, dependencies, acceptance outcomes, authorship, or original chronology. Translated approval statements are identified as translations, not new approvals. Where a historical status is outdated, retain its timing or add a clearly identified subsequent outcome.

## Historical and source boundaries

Do not rewrite Git history merely to translate old commit messages or historical document versions. Original source-document filenames are retained for provenance. Legal company names, account names, URLs, symbol names, runtime inventory, and machine identifiers are not translated. LICENSE was already in English and remains substantively unchanged.

No product code, new access, paid service, release, or implementation authorization is implied. START-00 / #41 records the separate implementation authorization; see ADR-0012. Future user conversations can stay in Norwegian while GitHub updates are written in English.
